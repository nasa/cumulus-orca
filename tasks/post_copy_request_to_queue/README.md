NAME
    post_copy_request_to_queue

DESCRIPTION
    Name: post_copy_request_to_queue.py
    Description:  lambda function that queries the db for file metadata, updates the status
    of recovered file to staged,
    and sends the staged file info to staged_recovery queue for further processing.

FUNCTIONS
    exponential_delay(base_delay: int, exponential_backoff: int = 2) -> int
        Exponential delay function. This function is used for retries during failure.
        Args:
            base_delay: Number of seconds to wait between recovery failure retries.
            exponential_backoff: The multiplier by which the retry interval increases during each attempt.
        Returns:
            An integer which is multiplication of base_delay and exponential_backoff.
        Raises:
            None
    
    get_metadata_sql(key_path: str) -> <function text at 0x000001DFBD0B10D0>
        Query for finding metadata based on key_path and PENDING status.
        
        Args:
            key_path (str): s3 key for the file less the bucket name
        
        Returns:
            (sqlalchemy.text): SQL statement
    
    handler(event: Dict[str, Any], context: None) -> None
        Lambda handler. This lambda calls the task function to perform db queries
        and send message to SQS.
        
            Environment Vars:
                PREFIX (string): the prefix
                DATABASE_PORT (string): the database port. The standard is 5432.
                DATABASE_NAME (string): the name of the database.
                DATABASE_USER (string): the name of the application user.
                DB_QUEUE_URL (string): the SQS URL for status-update-queue
                RECOVERY_QUEUE_URL (string): the SQS URL for staged_recovery_queue
            Parameter store:
                {prefix}-drdb-host (string): host name that will be retrieved from secrets manager
                {prefix}-drdb-user-pass (string):db password that will be retrieved from secrets manager
        Args:
            event:
                A dictionary from the S3 bucket. See schemas/input.json for more information.
            context: An object required by AWS Lambda. Unused.
        Returns:
            None
        Raises:
            Exception: If unable to retrieve the SQS URLs or exponential retry fields from env variables.
    
    task(record: Dict[str, Any], db_queue_url: str, recovery_queue_url: str, max_retries: int, retry_sleep_secs: int, retry_backoff: int) -> None
        Task called by the handler to perform the work.
        
        This task queries all entries from orca_recoverfile table
        that match the given filename and whose status_id is 'PENDING'.
        The result is then sent to the staged-recovery-queue SQS and status-update-queue SQS.
        
        Args:
            record: A dictionary passed through from the handler.
            db_queue_url: The SQS URL of status_update_queue
            recovery_queue_url: The SQS URL of staged_recovery_queue
            max_retries: Number of times the code will retry in case of failure.
            retry_sleep_secs: Number of seconds to wait between recovery failure retries.
            retry_backoff: The multiplier by which the retry interval increases during each attempt.
        Returns:
            None
        Raises:
            Exception: If unable to retrieve key_path or db parameters, convert db result to json,
            or post to queue.
