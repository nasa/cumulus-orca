## [Unreleased]

### Migration Notes
See the documentation for specifics on the various files and changes specified below.

- Update the buckets variable in `terraform.tfvars`. The ORCA bucket previously defined should now have a type of orca.
  ```terraform
  # OLD Setting
  buckets = {
    internal = {
      name = "my-internal-bucket",
      type = "internal"
    },
    ...
    glacier = {
      name = "my-orca-bucket",
      type = "glacier"
    }
  }

  # NEW Setting
  buckets = {
    internal = {
      name = "my-internal-bucket",
      type = "internal"
    },
    ...
    glacier = {
      name = "my-orca-bucket",
      type = "orca"
    }
  }

  ```
- Add the following ORCA required variable definition to your `variables.tf` or `orca_variables.tf` file.
  ```terraform
  variable "orca_default_bucket" {
    type        = string
    description = "Default ORCA S3 Glacier bucket to use."
  }
  ```
- Update the `terraform.tfvars` file with the value for `orca_default_bucket`.
  ```terraform
  orca_default_bucket = "my-orca-bucket"
  ```
- Update the `orca.tf` file to include all of the updated and new variables as seen below. Note the change to source and the commented out optional variables.
  ```terraform
  ## ORCA Module

### Added
- *ORCA-184* Added AWS API Gateway in lambdas.tf for the reconciliation lambda.
- *ORCA-177* Added AWS API Gateway in lambdas.tf for the request_status lambdas.
- *ORCA-181* Added orca_catalog_reporting_dummy lambda for integration testing.
- *ORCA-165* Added new lambda function *post_copy_request_to_queue.py* under *tasks/post_copy_request_to_queue/ for querying the DB 
  and  posting to two queues.
  Added unit tests *test_post_copy_request_to_queue.py* under *tasks/post_copy_request_to_queue/test/unit_tests/* to test the new lambda.
  Added new scripts *run_tests.sh* and *build.sh* under */tasks/post_copy_request_to_queue/bin* to run the unit tests.
- *ORCA-163* Added shared library *shared_recovery.py* under *tasks/shared_libraries/recovery/* for posting to status SQS queue.
  This include *post_status_for_job_to_queue()* function that posts status of jobs to SQS queue,
  *post_status_for_job_to_queue()* function that posts status of files to SQS queue,
  and *post_entry_to_queue()* function that is used by the above two functions for sending the message to the queue.
  Added unit tests *test_shared_recovery.py* under *tasks/shared_libraries/recovery/test/unit_tests/* to test shared library.
  Added new script *run_tests.sh* under *tasks/shared_libraries/recovery/bin* to run the unit tests.
- *ORCA-92* Added two lambdas (request_status_for_file and request_status_for_job)
  for use with the Cumulus dashboard. request_status_for_file will retrieve status
  for an individual file, with the optional parameter of which job you want the
  file's recovery status for. request_status_for_job will retrieve a summary of
  the job along with status totals. See the task's 'schemas' folder and the
  README.md files for more information and examples.
- *ORCA-157* Modified terraform module to add two SQS queues required by
  *copy_files_to_archive* lambda function. The first queue will be used by
  *copy_files_to_archive* lambda to get necessary information needed for copying
  next files. The second queue will be used by *copy_files_to_archive* lambda to
  write database status updates.
- Deployment and development documentation has been created for ORCA.
- *ORCA-119* Added new script *bin/create_release_documentation.sh* to deploy the
  documentation when the **RELEASE_FLAG** is set to `true` in Bamboo pipeline.

### Changed
- Glacier buckets meant for the ORCA archive now should be a type of orca instead of glacier. `{ my-orca-bucket = { name = "orca-primary-bucket", type = "orca" } }`.
- The `copy_to_glacier` lambda now requires a `ORCA_DEFAULT_BUCKET` variable to be set.
- Terraform variables have been renamed and updated to better match Cumulus and identify optional and required ORCA variables. The table below shows the changes and mappings to the new names.
  | Old Variable Name              | New Variable Name                                        | Notes                           |

- Task and module build scripts have been updated to better display error information and documented to the actual steps being performed.
- Documentation has been updated to better provide end users with information on ORCA.
- *ORCA-109* request_files now uses SQS queue for recovery status updates, and receives input from a separate SQS queue.
- *ORCA-91* copy_files_to_archive now uses SQS queue for recovery status updates. Will generate a job_id if none is given, and return it in the output.
- request_files now uses the same default glacier bucket as copy_to_glacier.
- *ORCA-172* db_deploy lambda now will migrate the database or create a new orca database based off of the presence of certain objects in the database. This has led to the addition/removal of environment variables and updates to the task documentation (README.md) and ORCA website documentation for architecture and ORCA schema information. The lambda has been modified to add future migrations.

### Deprecated
- None

### Removed
- The `request_status` lambda under */tasks* is removed since it is replaced by the `requests_status_for_job` 
  and `request_status_for_granule` lambdas. The terraform modules, shell scripts and variables related to the lambda are also removed.

### Fixed
- Updated IAM policies to better include all buckets by type instead of looking at the bucket variable key name.

### Security
- None


## [v2.0.1] 2021-2-5

### Changed
* *ORCA-125* BucketOwnerFullControl ACL is now set on for storage PUT requests in the copy_to_glacier lambda. This prevents errors during cross account (OU) copying of data.

## [v2.0.0] 2021-1-15

### Migration Notes
* *ORCA-67* The expected input/output of the copy_to_glacier lambda has been changed. See how to adopt these changes in
your Cumulus workflow [here](https://github.com/nasa/cumulus-orca/tree/master/tasks/copy_to_glacier).
* *ORCA-61* We now support collection-level configuration to exclude specific file-types from your glacier archive (when using
the copy_to_glacier lambda). See how to configure this for your collections [here](https://github.com/nasa/cumulus-orca/tree/master/tasks/copy_to_glacier#exclude-files-by-extension).

### Added
* *ORCA-58* ORCA user facing documentation
  * Docusaurus documentation website framework initialized and created
  * Initial content migrated off of wiki and into markdown pages for end users to view ORCA documentation with no wiki access.
  * Updates to README with starting the documentation server.
* *ORCA-61* Support dynamic configuration of files to exclude from glacier archive
  * Configured in a collection.meta configuration
* *ORCA-67* Generalize input/output scheme of copy_to_glacier lambda so it can be used more easily
in a Cumulus workflow.

### Changed
* *ORCA-68* Update DB tests to use mocking instead of real Postgres DB.
* *ORCA-70* As a DAAC we would like to be able to deploy multiple instances in our sandbox account.
  * Moves secret storage from SSM parameter store to secrets manager and adds a prefix to the keys.
* *ORCA-74* Move integration tests into their own files.


## [v1.0.0] 2020-12-4

### Migration Notes
None - this is the baseline release.

### Added
* *Misc*
  * Unit test upgrades - mocking unecessary dependencies.
  * Code formatting and styling
* *ORCA-65* Copy Lambda
  * We're including a copy lambda in the v1.0.0 release. The use of this lambda function is optional and explained in the task readme/documentation.
* *ORCA-33* Automated Building/Testing Updates
  * Created some bash scripts for use in the Bamboo build.
  * Updated requirements-dev.txt files for each task and moved the testing framework from nosetest (no longer supported) to coverage and pytest. 
  * Support in GitHub for automated build/test/release via Bamboo
  * Use `coverage` and `pytest` for coverage/testing
