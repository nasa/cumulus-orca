After versioning is enabled in a bucket, it can never return to an unversioned state but can only be suspended on that bucket. Versioning can help recover objects from accidental deletion or overwrite. For example, if an object is deleted, Amazon S3 inserts a delete marker instead of removing the object permanently. The delete marker becomes the current object version. If the object is overwritten, it results in a new object version in the bucket. The previous version can always be restored.
