description: Provides documentation for Operators to restore data back to ORCA.

import useBaseUrl from '@docusaurus/useBaseUrl';

The following operations procedure details how an operator would re-ingest data
into ORCA through the Cumulus Dashboard without running a full ingest pipeline.
At a high level, the following steps should be used to manually ingest data into
ORCA.

1. Use the Cumulus Dashboard Granule Bulk Operations functionality to run the
   **OrcaCopyToArchiveWorkflow** step function against the granules that need to
   be ingested into ORCA.
2. Monitor the execution status of the job and workflows.

The sections below go into further detail on how to accomplish the high level
steps above.

## Submit Granules to be Restored in ORCA

The following steps will guide the operator through submitting a bulk operation
to restore data in ORCA.

1. On the **Granules** tab of the Cumulus Dashboard, click on the **Granule Actions**
   button. The button is highlighted in figure 1 below.

2. Under **Granule Actions** click on the **Run Bulk Granules** button highlighted
   below in figure 2.

3. In the bulk operations pop up click on the **Bulk Operations** button as seen
   below in figure 3.

   **Figure 3. Select the Bulk Operations Button**

4. Fill out the details in the **Bulk Operations** form utilizing any of the bulk
   operations methods to provide the list of granules to act upon.
   :::important Workflow Name
    Make sure that the workflow name value is set to **OrcaCopyToArchiveWorkflow**
    as seen below in the figure.

    ```json
    {
      "WorkflowName": "OrcaCopyToArchiveWorkflow",
      "index": "",
      "query": "",
      "ids": [],
      "meta": {}
    }
    ```
   :::
   Figure 4 below shows using the *ids* key to list granules to act upon.
   Once the form is filled out, click the **Run Bulk Operations** button.

5. Save the Job ID value displayed in the **Bulk Granule Operations** pop up
   window as seen below in figure 5. The ID will be used used for monitoring.
   Click on the **Go To Operations** button to begin monitoring the job.

## Monitor Executions and Job Status

Monitoring the Bulk Granule Operations Job and *OrcaCopyToArchiveWorkflow*
workflow can be done through the *Operations* and *Executions* tabs. The Job ID
obtained from step 5 in the [Submit Granules to be Restored in ORCA](#submit-granules-to-be-restored-in-orca)
section above will be needed for monitoring.  The sections below go into more details.


### Monitoring the Overall Job via the Operations Tab

Using the obtained Job ID, the operations can be filtered. The page will provide
information on the overall bulk granule operations job and the status. This page
does not contain any further drill down, but an operator can view the *Executions*
tab for additional information. Figure 6 below shows the status of a job
submitted in the example used in the above figures.

**Figure 6. Monitoring the Operations Tab**


### Monitoring Individual Granules Executions via the Executions Tab

Using the obtained Job ID (*asyncOperationsId*), the executions can be filtered.
The page will provide the operator with information on each specific execution of the
*OrcaCopyToArchiveWorkflow* workflow. There is one execution per granule. The
execution can be drilled down further to look at failures and logs. Figure 7
below shows the status of executions based on a Job ID.
