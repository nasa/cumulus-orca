The ORCA software system is currently made up of three primary functions. The
first function is to archive a secondary copy of the data. This is done by
capitalizing on Cumulus Workflows and AWS Lambda. An end user would only need to
add the proper ORCA components to their ingest workflow in order to use the feature.
The second function is recovery of data from the secondary copy. Adding this functionality
is more involved but requires the user to add the proper components and
configuration to Cumulus to utilize. The final function is to provide end users
insight into the ORCA system for monitoring and data management. This is done by
providing the end user with an API to access information on the ORCA system. The
diagram below gives a software system view of ORCA and the various containers and
protocols used within the system. The following pages go into further details on
each container.
