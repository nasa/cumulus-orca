The archive data container contains all the components that make up the ORCA
ingest service functionality. The diagram below shows how the various components
interact. A majority of the work for this functionality is done by the
**copy_to_archive** lambda function, shown in AWS as **PREFIX_copy_to_orca**. 
This component was designed such that it
could be added to any ingest workflow in order to create a secondary archive copy
of the data for disaster recovery. Other than the lambda, the additional
archiving measures are handled through AWS S3 bucket policy and by components
used to write metadata to the ORCA catalog. This was done to preserve as much
metadata as possible about the files and to simplify interactions with the AWS
archive. The metadata written to the catalog is used for data management
of ORCA and supports features like reconciliation with Cumulus.
