The archive data container contains all the components that make up the archive
data functionality. The diagram below shows how the various components interact.
A majority of the work for this functionality is done by the **copy_to_glacier**
lambda function. This component was designed such that it could be added to any
ingest workflow in order to create a secondary archive copy of the data for
disaster recovery. Other than the lambda, the additional archiving measures are
handled through AWS S3 bucket policy. This was done to preserve as much metadata
as possible about the files and to simplify interactions with the AWS glacier
archive.
