ORCA utilizes a PostgreSQL compatible database instance in AWS. The ORCA database
is used to order to track and manage the status of a recovery in a typical recover
data workflow and to maintain a catalog of ORCA data stored in the S3
archive. The diagram below provides details on the tables and the services that
access them. The data within the ORCA Recovery Status tables is considered transient
and is typically no longer useful after a recovery has reached completion in a
successful state. The data within the ORCA Metadata Catalog tables points to the
latest version of the data stored in ORCA and provides a files association to a
granule, collection, and provider objects information. The ORCA Metadata Catalog
tables data are also used by ORCA services to perform vital ORCA data management
functions like reconciliation. The Schema Version Tracking table is used internally
by ORCA to know if any schema migrations are needed for the ORCA code to function
and provides an audit record of the installed ORCA schema.
