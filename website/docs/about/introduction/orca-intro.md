## What is ORCA?

The Operational Recovery Cloud Archive (ORCA) provides a baseline solution for
creating, and managing operational backups in the cloud. In addition, best
practices and recovery code that manages common baseline recovery scenarios is
also maintained. Requirements and use cases for ORCA are derived from the
ORCA Working Group.

## How do I implement or use ORCA?

Information on implementing ORCA is located [here](../../developer/deployment.md).
