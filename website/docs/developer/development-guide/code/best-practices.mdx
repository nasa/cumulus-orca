## Unit Testing
All code should reach minimum 80% coverage through [Unit Tests](unit-tests.md).

## Code Style
We use the [Google Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html) for style elements such as documentation, titling, and structure.
We also recommend reviewing [Clean Architecture](./clean-architecture.mdx)

## Stop on Failure
Failures within ORCA break through to the Cumulus workflow they are a part of.
To this end, raising an error is preferred over catching the error and returning a null value or error message.
The code examples below exemplify this idea by showing how to raise an error using python in different contexts.
```python
try:
    value = function(param)
except requests_db.DatabaseError as err:
    logging.error(err)
    raise
```
```python
if not success:
    logging.error(f"You may log additional information if desired. "
                  f"param: {param}")
    raise DescriptiveErrorType(f'Error message to be raised info Cumulus workflow.')
```
Retries can then be configured in the workflow json if desired. See
[documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/concepts-error-handling.html)
and
[tutorials](https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/hands-on/handle-serverless-application-errors-step-functions-lambda/)
for more information.
The following snippet from the copy_to_glacier lambda demonstrates usage of retries for a lambda in an ingest workflow.
`MaxAttempts` is set to 6, meaning that it will run the function a maximum of 7 times before transitioning to the `WorkflowFailed` state.
`IntervalSeconds` determines how many seconds the workflow will sleep between retries.
A `BackOffRate` of 2 means that the `IntervalSeconds` will be doubled on each failure beyond the first.

```json
"CopyToArchive": {
  ...
  "Type": "Task",
  "Resource": "${copy_to_glacier_task_arn}",
  "Retry": [
    {
      "ErrorEquals": [
        "Lambda.ServiceException",
        "Lambda.AWSLambdaException",
        "Lambda.SdkClientException"
      ],
      "IntervalSeconds": 2,
      "MaxAttempts": 6,
      "BackoffRate": 2
    }
  ],
  "Catch": [
    {
      "ErrorEquals": [
        "States.ALL"
      ],
      "ResultPath": "$.exception",
      "Next": "WorkflowFailed"
    }
  ],
  "Next": "WorkflowSucceeded"
},
```
If the retries are exceeded and the error is caught, then the workflow will show that it jumped to the `WorkflowFailed` state.
<img alt="Workflow Failed" src={useBaseUrl('img/Workflow Failed.png')} />

If the 'WorkflowFailed' state was not triggered, then the workflow will move on to the step defined in `Next`.
<img alt="Workflow Succeeded" src={useBaseUrl('img/Workflow Succeeded.png')} />

:::note
In the event that an error may be transient, and failing would cause a large amount of redundant work for other objects, retrying a failing operation in code is acceptable with a strictly limited number of retries.
You will likely want to log each individual error for analytics and debugging.
