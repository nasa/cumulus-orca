The ORCA recovery workflow diagram below visualizes the process of
recovering missing data in Cumulus. As each user organization will
have unique needs when recovering data, the diagram provides details
on which components can be modified and which components should not
be modified. Refer to the legend on the diagram for details on which
components can be modified.

A developer kicks off the recovery processes manually via the AWS UI,
which then triggers an API that kicks off a recovery workflow. Recovery is an asynchronous operation since data
requested from GLACIER can take 4 hours or more to reconstitute,
and DEEP_ARCHIVE can take 12 hours. 
Since it is asynchronous, the recovery container
relies on a database to maintain the status of the request and event
driven triggers to restore the data once it has been reconstituted
from archive into an S3 bucket. Currently data is copied back to the
Cumulus S3 primary data bucket which is the default bucket. The developer 
has the option to override the default bucket with another restore bucket if desired. 
Determining the status of the recovery job is done manually by querying the database
directly or by checking the status on the UI. In addition, you can also check the job status by calling the ORCA API.
