title: Deploy from Windows
description: A concrete set of instructions on deploying from Windows to create a test environment.

import useBaseUrl from '@docusaurus/useBaseUrl';

Deploying Cumulus, CumulusDashboard, and Orca from Windows brings some additional challenges.
The goal of this page is to provide a set of modified instructions to get around common errors.

### Notes
- Choose a PREFIX that will identify your installation when in AWS. This string will be used throughout deployment.
- Connect to the NASA VPN to be able to connect to AWS.
  :::warning
  The VPN drastically slows down Terraform operations, and limits what documentation can be viewed. Switch off when applicable.
  :::
- Commands here will use ```us-west-2``` for region because of the current state of our sandbox. Replace consistently as needed.
    - Make sure any operations in AWS are done under the correct region.

## Application
This application will be used in future steps to authenticate users.
- Go to https://uat.urs.earthdata.nasa.gov/profile
- Applications -> My Applications
- Create a new Application
    - Application ID: ```prefix_cumulus```
    - Application Name ```Prefix Cumulus```
    - Application Type: ```OAuth 2```
    - Redirect URL: todo

## Initial Setup
- Follow the [deployment environment setup instructions](setting-up-deployment-environment.mdx).
    - You may need to install Terraform manually.
    - Only configure the default profile.
    - Keep the access keys in plain-text. You will need to run ```aws configure``` in multiple environments.
- Create an AWS Key Value Pair by following  [the AWS instructions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html#having-ec2-create-your-key-pair).
    - Choose the '.pem' format.
    - Naming convention is PREFIX-key-pair.pem
- Create buckets in the same OU and region as the other installations.
    - Same OU and region would not be ideal for a real backup system, but is generally sufficient for testing.
    - Required buckets are PREFIX-tf-state, PREFIX-glacier, PREFIX-internal, PREFIX-private, PREFIX-protected, PREFIX-public, and PREFIX-orca
    :::tip
    An example command for creating a bucket in us-west-2. Remember to run ```aws configure``` first.
    ```commandline
    aws s3api create-bucket --bucket PREFIX-tf-state --profile default --region us-west-2 --create-bucket-configuration "LocationConstraint=us-west-2"
    ```

## [Cumulus](https://nasa.github.io/cumulus/docs/deployment/deployment-readme)
- If creating a realistic setup with multiple OUs, apply [Create the ORCA Archive Bucket](creating-orca-glacier-bucket.md) to your PREFIX-glacier.
- Run
  ```commandline
  aws dynamodb create-table --table-name PREFIX-tf-locks --attribute-definitions AttributeName=LockID,AttributeType=S --key-schema AttributeName=LockID,KeyType=HASH --billing-mode PAY_PER_REQUEST --region us-west-2
  ```
- Run
  ```commandline
  aws s3api put-bucket-versioning --bucket PREFIX-tf-state --versioning-configuration Status=Enabled
  ```
  :::warning
  We presently have no instructions for creating a VPC, Subnet, Security Group, or PostgreSQL database.
  Borrow them from an existing setup.
  :::
- Go to [this repo](https://git.earthdata.nasa.gov/projects/ORCA/repos/cumulus-orca-template-deploy/browse) and download.
- Unzip.
- Remove the '.example' on terraform.tf and terraform.tfvars files in data-persistence-tf, cumulus-tf, and rds-cluster-tf.
- In each terraform.tf and terraform.tfvars, use your own prefix, region, vpc id, and subnet ids.
  :::warning
  The region and prefix are not always in simple variables. Do a global search for 'PREFIX' and 'us-east-1'.
  :::
  :::warning
  Only use the non-lambda subnet id in the data-persistence-tf/terraform.tfvars. In cumulus-tf use both.
  :::
  :::warning
  Overwrite the ```orca-sandbox``` in ```orca-sandbox-tf-locks``` with your prefix as well.
  :::
- In rds-cluster-tf/terraform.tfvars
    - Use values of your choice for ```db_admin_username``` and ```db_admin_password```
    - Set ```tags``` to ```{ "Deployment" = "PREFIX" }```
    - Set ```permissions_boundary_arn``` to ```arn:aws:iam::YOUR ACCOUNT ID:policy/NGAPShRoleBoundary```
    - Add ```rds_user_password = "CumulusD3faultPassw0rd"``` and change as desired.
    - Set ```provision_user_database``` to ```true```
    - Set ```cluster_identifier``` to ```"PREFIX-cumulus-db"```

- In rds-cluster-tf/terraform.tf
    - Set ```bucket``` to ```"PREFIX-tf-state"```
    - Set ```key``` to ```"PREFIX/cumulus/terraform.tfstate"```
    - Set ```dynamodb_table``` to ```"PREFIX-tf-locks"```

- Go to https://github.com/asfadmin/CIRRUS-core/blob/master/Dockerfile and download the file to the same folder as your downloaded repo and orca folder.
  :::tip
  Make sure that no extension is added.
  :::
- Open a commandline in the same folder.
    - Run ```docker build -t orca .``` and ```docker run -it --rm -v pathToYourFolder:/CIRRUS-core orca /bin/bash```
    - The commandline should now be inside a docker container.
      ```bash
      cd cumulus-orca-template-deploy/rds-cluster-tf/
      aws configure
      terraform init
      terraform plan
      terraform apply
      ```

- In data-persistence-tf/terraform.tfvars
    - Set ```permissions_boundary_arn``` to ```arn:aws:iam::12345:policy/NGAPShRoleBoundary``` replacing the ```12345``` with your Account Id.
      <img alt="Location of Account Id" src={useBaseUrl('img/aws-account-id.PNG')} />
    - Set ```rds_user_access_secret_arn``` to the ```user_credentials_secret_urn``` output from ```terraform apply```.
    - Set ```rds_security_group``` to the ```security_group_id``` output from ```terraform apply```.
    - Set ```vpc_id``` to your borrowed VPC.

```bash
cd ../data-persistence-tf/
aws configure
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

- In cumulus-tf/terraform.tfvars
    - Add the line ```aws_profile = "default"```
    - Replace 12345 in permissions_boundary_arn with the Account Id.
    - Add to the buckets:
      ```
      default_orca = {
         name = "prefix-orca"
         type = "orca"
        },
        provider = {
          name = "orca-sandbox-s3-provider"
          type = "provider"
      }
      ```
      :::tip
      The "orca-sandbox-s3-provider" bucket contains test data.
      If creating a separate environment, you can create your own bucket.
      :::

    - Replace the ```cumulus_message_adapter_lambda_layer_version_arn``` with a valid one.

      :::warning
      Process for finding the correct arn is not documented.
      :::
-
    - Set the ```ecs_cluster_instance_image_id``` to ```""```
    - ```ecs_cluster_instance_subnet_ids``` and ```lambda_subnet_ids``` should have the same two values.
    - Set ```urs_client_id``` and ```urs_client_password``` to the values from your created application.
    - Add an extra property ```urs_url = "https://uat.urs.earthdata.nasa.gov"```
    - Add your username to the ```api_users```
    - Set ```token_secret``` to a value of your choice.
    - Comment out the ```archive_api_port``` property and value.
    - Uncomment the ```key_name property``` and set the value to ```"PREFIX-key-pair"```
    - Add this section to the bottom of the file and edit as desired:
      ```
      ## =============================================================================
      ## ORCA Variables
      ## =============================================================================

      ## REQUIRED TO BE SET
      ## -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

      ## ORCA application database user password.
      database_app_user_pw = "This1sAS3cr3t"

      ## Default ORCA S3 Glacier bucket to use
      orca_default_bucket = PREFIX-glacier"

      ## PostgreSQL database (root) user password
      postgres_user_pw = "An0th3rS3cr3t"
      ```
    :::warning
    The instructions in the tfvars file suggest swapping '12345' with your account ID. This may not work, depending on how your dependencies such as the cumulus_message_adapter_lambda_layer_version_arn were set up.
    :::
- In cumulus-tf/orca.tf:
    - You may change ```source``` to an alternate release. If local, make sure it is within the scope of the container.
```bash
cd ../cumulus-tf
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

## Orca
